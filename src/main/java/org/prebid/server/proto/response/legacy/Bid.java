/**
 * Bid is a bid from the auction. These are produced by Adapters, and target a particular Ad Unit.
 * <p>
 * This JSON format is a contract with both Prebid.js and Prebid-mobile.
 * All changes *must* be backwards compatible, since clients cannot be forced to update their code.
 * <p>
 * IMPORTANT: unlike other data classes this one is mutable (annotated with {@link Data} instead of
 * {@link lombok.Value}). Motivation: during the course of processing bids could be altered several times (caching,
 * targeting keywords). Creating new instance of the bid in each of these cases seems to cause unnecessary memory
 * pressure. In order to avoid unnecessary allocations this class is made mutable (as an exception) i.e. this
 * decision could be seen as a performance optimisation.
